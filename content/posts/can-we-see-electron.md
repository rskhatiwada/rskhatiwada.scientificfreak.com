# Can We See an Electron?

No, we can’t—at least not in the way we traditionally define "seeing." If we limit vision to what our biological eyes can detect, we hit a hard threshold at around 200 nm (nanometers). Anything below this is simply beyond human perception. But instead of asking, “Can we see an electron?” a better question might be: “Are electrons even out there for us to see?”

Our eyes evolved to detect only a narrow range of electromagnetic (EM) radiation—visible light. Anything outside this range, such as X-rays, gamma rays, and many other EM waves, remains invisible to us. We can only "see" things when they interact with EM waves in a way that produces visible light. But here’s where things get interesting: electrons do interact with EM waves, yet they remain invisible. Why?

## The Problem with Seeing Electrons

First, electrons are tiny—absurdly small. But more importantly, they are extremely light. If a photon (a particle of light) were to strike an electron in an attempt to illuminate it, the electron wouldn’t just sit there and reflect the light. Instead, it would get knocked away, accelerating instantly due to its tiny mass. This makes it fundamentally impossible to see an electron in the classical sense.

To "see" something means to localize it—to determine where it is. But localization itself is impossible for electrons because of their mass and quantum behavior. Instead, we describe their position using probability amplitudes, and the square of this quantity tells us the likelihood of finding an electron in a specific location at a given time.

## Are Electrons Particles or Waves?

Now comes the deeper mystery. Do electrons even exist as solid particles? We don’t know for sure. They exhibit both particle-like and wave-like characteristics, but we cannot simultaneously define their exact position and momentum (thanks to Heisenberg’s Uncertainty Principle). So, are they particles that behave like waves? Or waves that sometimes act like particles? Or maybe something else entirely?

The fact that we can’t localize them suggests that we can never truly "see" an electron. But if we can’t see them, how do we even know they exist?

## Verifying the Existence of Electrons

Fortunately, our experiments confirm their existence. Our physical models require electrons—without them, atoms wouldn’t hold together. So, we indirectly verify their presence through their effects rather than by direct observation. But then a strange thought arises: Do our models explain electrons, or do electrons only exist because our models say they should?

This is where Model-Dependent Realism kicks in. Maybe we’re just interpreting reality through the lens of our theories. Who knows? Maybe in the future, we’ll discover that what we currently call an "electron" is actually something else entirely—perhaps something we’ll name the “Dlectron” (because why not?). If it better fits the observational data, we’ll have no choice but to roll with it.

I, for one, am excited for that day.
